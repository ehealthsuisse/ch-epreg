### Introduction

The pregnancy passport contains all the important medical information that is necessary during pregnancy, birth and the 6 weeks afterwards to ensure comprehensive care. This information is entered in the pregnancy passport by healthcare providers such as gynaecologists, midwives, general practitioners and institutions such as clinics, birthing centres, practices or midwife organizations. 

The CH EPREG implementation guide describes the FHIR representation of the pregnancy passport in Switzerland. This implementation guide is dependent on [CH Core](http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-core/index.html) and [CH Term](http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-term/index.html), which describe the Swiss-specific context, particularly in relation to the Swiss EPR.

The implementation guide is based on the concept of the [ePregnancy passport](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/upload/documents/eSchwangerschaftspass_Konzept_de.pdf).
